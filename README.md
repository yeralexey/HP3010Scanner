# HP3010Scanner
This project, HP3010Scanner, is an inheritance of the hp3900-series project, originally created by Jonathan Bravo Lopez. The purpose of this project is to build upon the work done in hp3900-series, enhancing its functionality and features.

During the initialization of the HP3010Scanner project, special care was taken to preserve the exact folder structure and organization as established by the original author. However, a challenge was encountered while attempting to upload the project to GitHub. GitHub tends to be unhappy with empty folders, which were present in the repository.

To address this issue without altering the original commit history, a temporary file named "tempfile" was added to each branch. This addition was solely done to satisfy GitHub's requirements and prevent any loss or changes to the original commit history of the hp3900-series project.

For more detailed information about the project, its history, and the original hp3900-series project, please refer to the accompanying README files.

The inheritance from the hp3900-series project serves as a foundation for further development and improvements in the HP3010Scanner project. Any changes or enhancements made in this new project will be carefully documented to ensure transparency and recognition of the original contributions made by Jonathan Bravo Lopez in the hp3900-series project.
