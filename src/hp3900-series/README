If you read this README, you are getting a developing version of
hp3900-series backend. To make this project installable and
compilable use "pack.sh" script in this way:

./pack.sh -c

This command will create a compressed file in your home directory
named: hp3900-series.tar.bz2

Go to your home directory and uncompress that file:

cd ~
tar xfj hp3900-series.tar.bz2

cd hp3900-series-*

And that's all. You can use scripts available to update, compile and
install latest backend version.
