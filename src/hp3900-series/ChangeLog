HP Scanjet 3900 series CHANGELOG
================================

16-05-2013: v0.13-SVN
----------

 - Fixed reference position detection for HP3800/HPG2710 scanners.
 - Cleaned up code.
 - Initial port to SANE 1.1.0 specs.
 - Fixed warmup process.
 - Implemented native adcGain and adcOffset calibration.
 - Implemented native white/black shading calibration.
 - Implemented native gamma correction.
 - Implemented scans "preview mode".
 - Added support for HP ScanJet G3110 (HPG3110).

01-03-2008: v0.12
----------

 - Added --qbuttons argument to query the last button status or wait for
   pressing button before exiting stand-alone application. Thanks to Ed K.
 - tiffio.h library is now optional in SANE backend.
 - Added support for a new scanner: HP ScanJet G2710 which is similar to
   HP ScanJet 3800.
 - Fixed initial tl_x and tl_y coords so "scanimage --test" passes test.
 - INSTALL.sh script places driver both in /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 for
   machines supporting such architecture.
 - COMPILE.sh script cares about usb.h presence and notifies its absence.
 - UPDATE.sh script updates installer scripts.
 - Fixed grayscale emulation (broken when enabling grayscale support by chipset)
 - Grayscale emulation now generates 1 channel per dot instead of three ones.
 - COMPILE.sh script generates a log when compiling SANE's backend.

21-12-2007: v0.11
----------

 - Fixed a bug that made slide/negative scans unusable.
 - Changed area constrains in slide/negative scans.

11-12-2007: v0.10
----------

 - Added INFO.sh script to provide information about project versions.
 - Added PATCH.sh script to patch SANE sources by hand.
 - Implemented emulation of white shading correction.
 - Added option to disable white shading correction.
 - Backend now checks whether chipset supports operations with eeprom.
 - Added a simple GUI (hp3900.kmdr) for standalone application (uses
   kmdr-executor) made by Bruno <brunomcl at users.sourceforge.net>
 - Debugging functions moved from hp3900_rts8822.c to hp3900_debug.c
 - Removed many global vars.
 - Grayscale color mode is totally supported by hardware.
 - Grayscale emulation is now optional. "--color 3" argument is added
   in stand-alone application and "Emulate Grayscale" option in SANE.
   Emulation remains as optional because sometimes converted image has
   better quality than scanned one in real Grayscale mode.
 - Debugging images created with option --savecalibfile are saved now
   at user home ~/
 - Added option in SANE backend to generate debugging images.
 - As a debugging image, driver creates post-autoref.tiff which shows
   colored lines about detected SER and LER values.
 - Lineart scans generate 1 bit depth images.
 - Fixed threshold limits for lineart scans in stand-alone app

29.07.2007: v0.9
----------

 - Added support for scanner: HP ScanJet G3010 (similar to hp4370)
 - Added initial support for scanner: BenQ 5550T (New chipset: RTS8823L-01E).
 - Fixed bug related to stepper motor, programming smearing curves for
   backtracking.
 - Implemented algorithm to detect installed RAM type.
 - Implemented a better code to read/write in DMA.
 - Added some scripts for users, to update, compile and install sources.

06.04.2007: v0.8
----------

 - Negative scans invert colours by default.
 - Added --negative option in stand-alone application.
 - Cleaned up sane interface and added some advanced options for debugging
   purposes.
 - Added --gamma-off to disable gamma correction.
 - if gamma is enabled, scans are always made in 16 bits depth and then
   converted to the selected depth (default 8) to improve image quality.
   To avoid depth emulation, argument "--real-depth" is added.
 - Added --buttons argument to test device's buttons.
 - Fixed a problem when getting buttons' status.
 - Rewrited hp3900_config.c to support other scanners in an easier way.
 - Added configuration to support HP Scanjet 3800 (New chipset:RTS8822BL-03A).
 - Fixed warmup process.
 - Added --nowarmup argument to skip such proccess.
 - Identified bits to enable/disable motor and to manage motor direction.
 - Added buttons support like avision backend to work with KScannerButtons.
 - Added --scancount argument to get the number of scans made by scanner in
   standalone application.
 - Added posibility to see information about device in sane version like
   chipset name, chipset ID and number of scans made by scanner.
 - It seems that using RTS8822BL-03A, both lamps can be switched on at the
   same time being switched on when scanning slides. Identified the way it
   works and fixed the problem.
 - Sane version detects now whether TMA is attached or not when scanning
   slides and negatives.

09.10.2006: v0.7
----------

 - Identified some usb commands involved in DMA and EEPROM operations.
 - Identified usb command to reset RTS8822 chipset.
   Added option --chipset-reset
 - Added option --help-debug to show debugging options
 - Added support for HP ScanJet 4370 with resolutions lower than 1200. 
 - Resolution 2400 works too for HP ScanJet 4370 (1200dpi still fails)
 - Fixed bug when setting sensor timing values. This fix should improve image
   quality in slide and negative scans.

02.07.2006: v0.6
----------

 - Added option "--inches" in stand-alone application to let users set
   coordinates in inches unit.
 - Added option "--chipset" in stand-alone to show chipset's information.
 - Application uses different scanning areas when scanning slides, depending
   on device used (hp3970c or hp4070).
 - Slide/negative process use the right lamp now.
 - Cleaning up code.
 - Identified register which manages scanner buttons' status.
 - Some calibration functions implemented
 - Fixed bug which generates bad images in lower resolutions after scanning
   in 2400dpi.
 - Adding some options for debugging purposes in stand-alone application.
 
01.04.2006: v0.5
----------
 - Fixed bug when creating RGB triplet in 2400 dpi scanning process.
 - Coordinates in stand-alone application must be given in milimiters.
 - Implemented gamma correction, emulated in software.
 - Implemented scanning in "Gray" color mode, emulated in software.
 - Implemented scanning in "Lineart" mode, emulated in software.
 - Stand-alone app saves scanned image in TIFF format now.
 - Fixed scanning process in 16 bit depth.
 - Set 8 bit depth by default in SANE backend due to Kooka doesn't support
   16 bit depth.
 - Scanner is detected now as "Hewlett-Packard RTS8822 chipset based flatbed
   scanner" instead of "Hewlett-Packard HP39xx Flatbed Scanner"

20.02.2006: v0.4
----------
 - Added functions to get/set scanner's gamma values.
 - Added functions to resize image when selecting some non standard resolution.
 - Fixed bug in stand-alone application when setting depth parameter.
 - Fixed bug that crashes kooka application when making preview scans in 75 dpi.
 - Fixed bug that crashes frontends when scanning in 2400 dpi due to memory fault.
 - Improved sane_read function to read correctly image lines when maxlen is lower
   than a line size.

24.01.2006: v0.3
----------
 - Renamed .h files to .c files
 - Improved color in scanned images
 - Fixed all warnings when compiling as SANE backend
 - Fixed all illegal symbols
 - Reimplemented DBG function for debugging process in standalone application.
 - Fixed a bug that crashes backend when scanning in 2400 dpi twice.
 - README explains how to use scanner from a non root acount.
 - More improvements in internal code.

22.12.2005: v0.2
----------
 - Second release of standalone application
 - First version available of a SANE backend
 - Fixed Scan_Read_BufferA function to read image correctly
 - Fixed lamp relocation prior to scan image
 - Added a manual for standalone application
 - Implemented hp3900_config.h to avoid using external config files to
   program Realtek RTS8822l-01 chipset.
 - Many internal bugs fixed
