HP3900 driver supports some RTS8822 chipsets. But development is not completed
so all involved scanners may have different supporting status. Next list shows
current status of each known scanner:

HP Scanjet 3800
---------------
* Sensor : CCD Toshiba TCD2905
* Chipset: RTS8822BL-03A (Hardware resolutions 150, 300,  600, 1200, 2400)
* Status:
    o Resolutions: Supported resolutions lower than 1200dpi. 1200dpi doesn't
                   finish and in 2400dpi header tries to go beyond the limit
		   of area to scan.
    o Calibration:
        + Shading: Implementing (not supported yet)
        + Gamma  : Emulated (Implemented but not used yet)
    o Scan types:
        + Reflective: Supported
        + Slides    : Supported
        + Negatives : Supported
    o Color modes:
        + Color  : Supported
        + Gray   : Emulated (not supported yet)
        + Lineart: Emulated (not supported yet)
	


HP Scanjet 3970
---------------
* Sensor : CCD Toshiba TCD2952
* Chipset: RTS8822L-01H (Hardware resolutions 100, 200, 300,  600, 1200, 2400)
* Status :
    o Resolutions: All supported
    o Calibration:
        + Shading: Implementing (not supported yet)
        + Gamma  : Emulated (Implemented but not used yet)
    o Scan types:
        + Reflective: Supported
        + Slides    : Supported
        + Negatives : Supported
    o Color modes:
        + Color  : Supported
        + Gray   : Emulated (not supported yet)
        + Lineart: Emulated (not supported yet)



HP Scanjet 4070
---------------
* Sensor : CCD Toshiba TCD2952
* Chipset: RTS8822L-01H (Hardware resolutions 100, 200, 300,  600, 1200, 2400)
* Status :
    o Resolutions: All supported
    o Calibration:
        + Shading: Implementing (not supported yet)
        + Gamma  : Emulated (Implemented but not used yet)
    o Scan types:
        + Reflective: Supported
        + Slides    : Supported
        + Negatives : Supported
    o Color modes:
        + Color  : Supported
        + Gray   : Emulated (not supported yet)
        + Lineart: Emulated (not supported yet)



HP Scanjet 4370
---------------
* Sensor : CCD Toshiba TCD2958
* Chipset: RTS8822L-02A (Hardware resolutions 150, 300,  600, 1200, 2400, 4800)
* Status :
    o Resolutions: Supported ones lower than 1200. The others seem to have different line distances bettwen channel colors.
    o Calibration:
        + Shading: Implementing (not supported yet)
        + Gamma  : Emulated (Implemented but not used yet)
    o Scan types:
        + Reflective: Supported
        + Slides    : Supported
        + Negatives : Supported
    o Color modes:	
        + Color  : Supported
        + Gray   : Emulated (not supported yet)
        + Lineart: Emulated (not supported yet)



HP Scanjet G3010
----------------
* Sensor : CCD Toshiba TCD2958
* Chipset: RTS8822L-02A (Hardware resolutions 150, 300,  600, 1200, 2400, 4800)
* Status :
    o Resolutions: Supported ones lower than 1200. The others seem to have different line distances bettwen channel colors.
    o Calibration:
        + Shading: Implementing (not supported yet)
        + Gamma  : Emulated (Implemented but not used yet)
    o Scan types:
        + Reflective: Supported
        + Slides    : Supported
        + Negatives : Supported
    o Color modes:
        + Color  : Supported
        + Gray   : Emulated (not supported yet)
        + Lineart: Emulated (not supported yet)



Umax Astra 4900/4950
--------------------
* Sensor : CIS Sony S575
* Chipset: RTS8822L-01H (Hardware resolutions 100, 200, 300, 600, 1200)
* Status : Developing. There are problems setting up CIS sensor so retrieved image is not correct.
